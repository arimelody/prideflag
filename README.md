# progressive pride flag! 🌈

## made with ❤ by mellodoot

a lovely little pride flag made in svg, loaded with js, and optimised to be nice and lightweight!

it tucks into the top-right corner of any website you drop it on, and you're free to link it to whichever lgbt-supporting site you like :)

this flag is currently in use over at my own website, [mellodoot.com](https://mellodoot.com)! feel free to check it out if you'd like to see it in action!

## how do I use this on my own website?

simple! just slap this code into your html document, and the js file will be automagically loaded into your site, generating your flag!

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.mellodoot.com/js/pridetriangle.js" defer></script>
```

...or copy the code from `pridetriangle.js` and drop it into your own self-hosted file. up to you!

have fun spreading the gay! 🌈
