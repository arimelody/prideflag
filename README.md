# progressive pride flag! 🌈

## made with ❤ by ari melody

a lovely little pride flag made in svg, loaded with js, and optimised to be nice and lightweight!

it tucks into the top-right corner of any website you drop it on, and you're free to link it to whichever lgbt-supporting site you like :)

![progressive pride flag](pridetriangle.svg)

this flag currently represents:

- original LGBTQ+ colours! 🏳️‍🌈
- marginalized people of colour (POC) communities! 🧑🏾🧔🏿
- trans pride! 🏳️‍⚧️
- intersex! ♂️ ♀️

this flag is currently in use over at my own website, [arimelody.me](https://arimelody.me)! feel free to check it out if you'd like to see it in action!

## how do I use this on my own website?

simple! just slap [prideflag.js](prideflag.js) onto your website, and the js file will automagically generate your flag on page load!

have fun spreading the gay! 🌈
