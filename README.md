# progressive pride flag! 🌈
## made with ❤ by mellodoot!

a lovely little pride flag made in vector, and optimised to be nice and lightweight!

it tucks into the top-left or top-right corner of any website you drop it on, and you're free to link it to whichever lgbt-supporting site you like :)

this flag is currently in use over at my own website, [mellodoot.com](https://mellodoot.com)! feel free to check it out if you'd like to see it in action!

### how do I put this in the top-right of my website?
simple! just add `right` as an attribute to the surrounding `<a>` tag! the css stylesheet will handle the rest :)

**example:**
```html
<a id="pride-triangle" ... right>
```

have fun spreading the gay! 🌈
